                    In September 2018, hurricane Florence struck the North Carolina coast as a powerful Category 1 storm. It brought with it not only high winds,
                    but also record levels of rainfall. In its path was the North Carolina shoreline. Onslow County took a direct hit from Hurricane Florence.
                    With some areas in the county receiving over 30 inches of rainfall over the course of the multi-day storm, there was massive flooding.

                <p>
                    The Onslow Water and Sewer Authority (ONWASA) is responsible for providing clean water to the over 175,000 people who live in Onslow County.
                    With all the flooding and infrastructure damage, they had an incredible task ahead of them. What they didn’t realize was that
                    the hurricane was not the only problem they were going to face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting on October 4th, ONWASA IT personnel noticed an aggressive malware infiltrating their network defenses.
                    It was a well-known and dangerous malware called Emotet. Despite their multi-layered security protections, the IT staff struggled to control it.
                    Then it took a turn for the worse. Around 3am on October 13th, the Emotet malware contacted its command and control servers and downloaded a new payload,
                    the ransomware RYUK. This ransomware encrypted and locked out all of ONWASA’s computers unless a ransom was paid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On October 15th, ONWASA issued a <a href="https://www.onwasa.com/DocumentCenter/View/3701/Scan-from-2018-10-15-08_08_13-A">press release</a>
                    saying that their network was compromised and all computer systems used to process service orders, manage water connections/disconnections,
                    and all engineering activities were inoperable. ONWASA refused to pay the ransom and had to revert to responding to all requests using
                    manual processes. The water authority spent weeks recovering from the attack.

                Emotet is causing problems beyond just ONWASA. The Quarterly Threat Report for the third quarter, 2018 from
                <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us">Proofpoint</a> (a cybersecurity company that provides threat intelligence on the latest
                cyber attacks being launched via multiple sources) shows that banking trojans are the largest, most active category of
                malware across email, mobile apps, and social media.

            </p>
            <p>Of banking trojans, Emotet is the second most popular malware in use today.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
                A key element in Emotet's attack sequence is its communication with command and control servers (C2 servers). Emotet thives on its ability to
                update itself and offer iteself on the black market as a platform for further malware delivery. It was this capability that downloaded
                the ransomeware that caused the most acute trouble for ONWASA.

            </p>

            <p>
                Emotet is one of many malware variants that utilize a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to evade established malware protection
                strategies. These domain generating algorithms are capable of creating thousands of domains per day. The typical operation of 
                DGA-based malware is depicted in the diagram below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="displayed" src="{{url_for('static', filename='css/DGAalgorithm.png') }}" alt="DGA-based malware operation">
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                    <li>Step 1: The malware sends requests to a DNS server to see if a generated domain exists.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: The vast majority of domains do not exist.</li>
                    <li>
                        Step 3: But for the malware operator, that is ok. They only need to register a small percentage of the domains for the 
                        malware to connect successfully to its C2 server. Once the malware has the IP address, the malware can then request 
                        its update.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 4: The C2 server sends an update which launches the next phase of the attack.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The asymmetry of the DGA works to the advantage of the attacker. The bad guys only have to register a statistically small number 
                of these domains for the malware to receive their instructions. The good guys would have a full time job trying to chase down 
                all of those domains and blocking them.</p>
            <p>
                Thousands of malware rely on this communication technique to advance their goals and take advantage of their victims.
                Our team is dedicated to stopping these communications in their tracks.

            <p>We believe that a combination of threat intelligence and machine learning integrated into DNS servers can halt the C2 server communications 
                used by malware.</p>
            <p>
                Our solution is RequeX DNS, a cloud-based, network security intelligent DNS firewall that protects consumers and businesses. Rather than
                preventing the initial infection, the goal of RequeX DNS is to halt all communications from a malware to its command and control servers.
            </p>
            <p>Most DNS servers do not block traffic, and most DNS firewalls only use blacklists of known malicious domain names to determine if a domain 
                is malicious or benign.</p>
            <p>
                Our post-infection protection system uses a modified DNS server to prevent communications between malware and C2 servers.
                It can also be used to identify which networks and computers on a network are infected by DGA-based malware.
            </p>
            <p>Below is an updated diagram illustrating how our solution works. In this diagram you can see the same process as in the previous section, 
                however the last domain is blocked by our model.</p>
            <p>
                <img class="displayed" src="{{url_for('static', filename='css/RequeXDiagram.png') }}" alt="DNS solution that halts communication with C2 servers">
            </p>
            <p>
                Our solution uses machine learning models to classify domain requests as malicious or non-malicious. If they are deemed malicious,
                our models will block the DNS traffic. This blockage prevents the malware from communicating with its C2 server. 
                In ONWASA’s case, the RYUK ransomware would never have attacked them.
