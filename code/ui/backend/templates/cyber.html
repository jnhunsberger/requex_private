                    In September 2018, hurricane Florence struck the North Carolina shoreline. It brought Category 1 force winds and massive flooding.

                <p>Hackers also sensed an opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    The hackers had in their sights the Onslow Water and Sewer Authority (or ONWASA).
                    It is responsible for providing clean water to 175,000 people in the region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the middle of their disaster response, hackers planted a trojan-horse malware called Emotet on their network. 
                    After lying dormant for a few weeks, the Emotet-infected computers contacted their remote command and control servers and 
                    downloaded new malware to ONWASA’s computers. This ransomware encrypted and locked out all of ONWASA’s customer-facing systems. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only way to recover them was for ONWASA to pay a ransom to the hackers. With no guarantee that the hackers would honor the 
                    terms of their extortion, ONWASA refused to pay. They had to revert to responding to all requests using manual processes. 
                    It took weeks for ONWASA to recover. As a result, the malware directly impacted ONWASA’s ability to respond quickly and 
                    timely to their customers in their time of need.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, the impact was not greater.

                    The cyber attack experienced by ONWASA is just one of many similar attacks. There are two key aspects to these attacks which are defined below.
                </p>
                <h3>Command and Control Servers</h3>
                <p>
                    This diagram from US-CERT shows how Emotet and similar malware works. We have highlighted in green a key step in Emotet’s attack sequence:
                    its communication with command and control servers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="displayed" src="{{url_for('static', filename='css/emotet_infection_process.png') }}"
                         alt="Emotet infection process">
                    <figcaption>Source: US-CERT, emphasis on step 3 added</figcaption>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Communication with command and control servers (C2 servers) allows malware to download new attack instructions or to monetize their botnet by selling
                    access to the network of infected computers. It was this capability that downloaded the ransomware that caused the most acute trouble for ONWASA.
                </p>

                <h3>Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)</h3>
                <p>
                    Emotet is one of many malware variants that utilize a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to evade
                    established malware protection strategies. These domain generating algorithms can create thousands of domains per
                    day. The typical operation of DGA-based malware is depicted in the diagram below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img class="displayed" src="{{url_for('static', filename='css/dga_algorithm.png') }}" alt="DGA-based malware operation">
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
                        <li>Step 1: The malware sends requests to a DNS server to see if a generated domain exists.</li>
                        <li>Step 2: The DNS server responds with an IP address, or a message that the domain does not exist.</li>
                        <li>Step 3: Once the malware has the IP address, the malware can then request its update.</li>
                        <li>Step 4: The C2 server sends an update which launches the next phase of the attack.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vast majority of DGA domains do not exist. But that is not a problem for the malware operator. They only need to register a small
                    percentage of the domains for the malware to connect successfully to its C2 server. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditionally, security teams rely on static rules and blacklists to block communication with malicious domains. These methods are
                    increasingly ineffective as malware evolves to use genrated domains. Malware like Emotet, uses domain generating algorithms to 
                    generate thousands of domains every day. There are now too many domain names being generated each day for security teams to try to block all of them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our team aims to solve this problem by using models that can predict whether a domain is malicious and block communications without using static lists.
                    We believe that a combination of threat intelligence and machine learning integrated into DNS servers can halt the C2 server communications
                    used by malware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution is Reque<span style="color: red;">&#x2718;</span> DNS, a cloud-based, network security intelligent DNS firewall that protects
                    consumers and businesses. Rather than preventing the initial infection, the goal of Reque<span style="color: red;">&#x2718;</span> DNS
                    is to halt all communications from a malware to its command and control servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most DNS servers do not block traffic, and most DNS firewalls only use blacklists of known malicious
                    domain names to determine if a domain is malicious or benign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our post-infection protection system uses a modified DNS server to prevent communications between malware and C2 servers. It can also be
                    used to identify which networks and computers on a network are infected by DGA-based malware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution uses machine learning models to classify domain requests as benign or non-malicious. If they are deemed malicious,
                    our models will block the DNS traffic. This blockage prevents the malware from communicating with its C2 server.
                    In ONWASA’s case, the RYUK ransomware would never have attacked them.

                <p>
                    In this diagram you can see a similar process as in the previous section, however when the malware infected computer sends a request
                    to the DNS server, Reque<span style="color: red;">&#x2718;</span> DNS analyzes the domain request with our deep learning model and determines that it is
                    a malicious domain. In this case, the server responds with NXDOMAIN, the same as if the domain did not exist. Since the computer is not able
                    to connect with the C2 server, no additional malware is downloaded.

                    RequeX architecture has three layers - training, inference and the application. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the important aspects of this problem space is that the malware keeps transforming with new algorithms, so the models and inferences 
                    need to be up to date for the DNS server to be effective in blocking the malicious domains. We use a layered architecture that can keep up 
                    with the changing datasets and evolving models, while keeping the application interface the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the <i>training</i> layer, we have a pipeline to collect the data from different sources and then cleanup and merge them into a single dataset. 
                    This data is used to train our models. The trained models are evaluated and the best models are updated to the inference layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the <i>inference</i> layer, the model is served in an inference engine using an Apache Storm based pipeline which listens on a kafka bus for new requests. 
                    The inferences include a binary classification of whether a domain is malicious or benign, and a sub-classification of the malicious domains. 
                    These inferences are published on the kafka bus to serve applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the <i>application</i> layer, we will have DNS resolvers with a frontend load balancer and a DNS Master. These servers connect to the 
                    inference layer using the kafka bus with different topics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a computer is configured with our Reque<span style="color: red;">&#x2718;</span>  DNS server, the requests are sent to one of these DNS resolvers. The resolvers publish any unresolved domains
                    on a topic to the kafka bus served by the inference engine. The inference engine responds with the responses on the kafka bus with another topic.
                    The DNS master listens to these topics and updates its Response Policy Zone (RPZ) list and publishes them to the DNS resolvers.
                </p>

                <p>As seen below, there are several ways in which our output data can be consumed. At a basic level, a domain name can be run through the system using
                    a cURL command or our web UI, or it can be accessed by a DNS server via Kafka. REST APIs are provided from our inference engine which runs on Flask.</p>

                <p>
                    Our data came from two main sources: the free <a href="http://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/umbrella-static/index.html">Cisco Umbrella</a> list of the top million domain
                    names by popularity, which we assumed to be benign, and <a href="https://osint.bambenekconsulting.com/feeds/">Bambenek Consulting's free feeds</a> of
                    recent DGA domains. For the Bambenek list, we used both the default (or mixed) confidence feed,
                    and the high confidence feed. We analyzed a total of 1.36M domain names, 1 million benign (73.5%)
                    and 360k malicious (26.5%).
                </p>
                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    We performed some EDA on the datasets to see if there were obvious differences in the names of the DGA domains and the
                    benign domains. A few differences were apparent. Although we did not ultimately use the EDA for feature engineering,
                    it served as a way to confirm the datasets should be different enough to predict using machine learning.

                    The data sets have distinct differences in frequency counts. There are far more j's, q's, x's and z's in the malicious
                    domain names than in the benign ones. There are also no dashes in the malicious domain names and far more periods in the
                    benign dataset.

                <p class="subheading">Heirarchy Count Analysis</p>
                <p>We calculated the heirarchy count for each domain name. Amazon.com would have a heirarchy count of 2, while pages.github.com

                </p>
                <p>The one feature that jumps out is that benign domain names are more likely to have higher heirarchies than the malicious domain names, 
                    while the malicious DGA domains predominantly have heirarchy counts of 2. This matches what we saw above, that benign domain
                    names have far more periods in them.</p>

                    The distribution of benign domain names is a fairly standard distribution that peaks
                    around 16 characters. Both the mixed and high confidence datasets have a second peak around 30 characters. You can also see
                    that domain names of lengths less than 10 characters or greater than 33 are more likely to be benign than malicious.

                    Of special note is the that .ru (for Russia) is the 4th most common top level domain in the Cisco Umbrella set. The .biz domain
                    is also far more common in the malicious datasets. And especially interesting is that the .pw domain is the 6th most common
                    top level domain for the malicious data sets, given that it is the country code top-level domain for Palau, an island nation
                    with a population size of roughly 22,000.

                <p>
                    Our main objective was to predict whether a domain name represented a malicious website or
                    a benign one, with at least
                    a 99% accuracy. Our second objective was to predict the DGA class of domain names deemed
                    malicious. And our third
                    objective was to minimize our false positives so as not to block benign websites.
                </p>

                <h3>The Machine Learning Model</h3>
                <p>Whe chose to start with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network classifier based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00791">research by Endgame, Inc</a> in 2016.
                    Employing an LSTM model avoids the vanishing gradients problem common with recurrent neural networks.</p>
                <p>
                    To prepare the data for training, we tokenized the domain name strings by converting the characters
                    in the domain names to an integer-based sequence.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We created binary and multi-class LSTM models. After evaluating these LSTM models, we compared against a logistic regression model,
                    which performed significantly worse for classifying domain names.
